// What is JavaScript?
        // JavaScript is a programming languaage that makes websites interactive and dynamic.
        // Imagine a website as a house. 
            // The structure of the house would be HTML
            // The house decorations would be CSS
            // And the electricity that allows everything to turn on would be JavaScript.
